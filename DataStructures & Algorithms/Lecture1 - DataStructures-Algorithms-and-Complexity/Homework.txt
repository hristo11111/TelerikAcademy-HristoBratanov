1.Problem - answer: O(n^2).
The complexity of the first loop is O(n).
The complexity of the nested loop is O(n).

so, the overall complexity is O(n^2).

2.Problem - answer: O(n*m).
The complexity of the first loop is O(n).
The complexity of the nested loop is O(m).

so, the overall complexity is O(n*m).
